**Speech_Recognization-1-digit-number**
Implemented Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) from scratch for speech recognition of single digits, achieving
high accuracy. Successfully developed signal templates using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
and utilized them to calculate Cumulative Distance Matrices for differentiating between templates
